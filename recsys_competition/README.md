When conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on these tables, I would recommend checking the following aspects:

**1. Data types and missing values**

Check the data types of each column in all three tables and ensure that they are in the correct format (e.g., numeric data should be in numeric format, date data should be in date format, etc.). Also, check for missing values in all the tables and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle them (e.g., imputation, deletion, or ignore if the number of missing values is low).

**2. Data distribution and descriptive statistics**

Check the distribution of data in all columns in all three tables using summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles. Also, plot histograms, box plots, or density plots to visualize the distribution of data in each column. This will help to identify any outliers or skewness in the data.

**3. Correlation and relationships between variables**

Check the correlation between different variables in each table and between the tables themselves. For example, check if there is a relationship between a user's age and the books they rate, or if there is a relationship between the category of books and the publisher. This can be done using scatter plots, correlation matrices, or heatmaps.

**4. Data quality and consistency**

Check for any data quality or consistency issues, such as inconsistent spellings or inconsistent use of units of measurement. Also, check if the data follows the expected business rules and constraints (e.g., if age values are within an expected range).

**5. Outliers and anomalies**

Check for outliers or anomalies in the data, which may indicate data entry errors or other issues. This can be done using box plots, scatter plots, or histograms.

In summary, the EDA process for these three tables should involve checking the data types and missing values, data distribution and descriptive statistics, correlation and relationships between variables, data quality and consistency, and outliers and anomalies. By thoroughly analyzing these aspects, we can gain a better understanding of the data and identify any issues that need to be addressed before further analysis or modeling.
